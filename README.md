### NEXT
- Bugfix - Alarm Menu
  - Alarm threshold would show 0 instead of "Off"
  - fixed by removing the AlarmXEnabled variable since it was directly derived from the AlarmXThreshold variable
- Cleanup - removed AlarmXEnabled from the communication commands
- Tweak - On Module Menu moved the module index to the lower right since that space is used the least
- Tweak - On the Detail menu changed "Used" to "Left" - better meaning of what is shown
