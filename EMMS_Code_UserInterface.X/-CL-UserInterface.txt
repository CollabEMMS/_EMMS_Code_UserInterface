    UART functions on the command board are causing reset issues
    The command board UART functions have been rewritten to use the SPI
    communication code - the same is being done here.
    Communication code copied from power sense module

    currentLoad - Changed processing of communication incoming currentLoad to interpret it as a unsigned long instead of an integer
            using strtoul instead of atoi
        also changed where currentLoad is written to the display from utoa to ultoa
        the currentLoad variable is already a unsigned long, so no other changes
